# Autonomi Network GUI

A graphical user interface wrapper for the Autonomi Network CLI tool, making the decentralized internet more accessible to everyone.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how Autonomi Network's powerful CLI functionality can be wrapped in a user-friendly GUI. Autonomi Network is building "an Internet controlled by no-one, owned by us all" - secure, encrypted, and autonomous infrastructure for the next web.

## Project Goals

Aligned with Autonomi Network's vision:
- Support the creation of a decentralized internet infrastructure
- Enable users to participate in the quantum-secure, private network
- Make network operations accessible to non-technical users
- Help utilize the untapped storage capacity of everyday devices
- Facilitate the growth of a truly decentralized web

## Features

### Register Operations
- Create and manage human-readable names on the network
- Associate names with values
- View all registered names
- Secure operations with signing keys

### Key Management
- Generate quantum-secure signing keys
- Option to overwrite existing keys
- Automatic key detection and management

### Vault Operations
- Create and manage network vaults
- Participate in the decentralized storage network
- Configure vault settings (delay, local mode)
- Monitor vault status and health
- Contribute to the network's storage capacity (currently at 61.94 PiB)

### Wallet Operations
- Create new wallets
- Import existing MetaMask wallets
- Check wallet balance
- Secure password handling
- Manage ANT tokens for network operations

### File Operations
- Upload files with quantum-secure encryption
- Public or private file sharing options
- Download files using addresses
- Calculate one-time storage costs
- Track and manage stored files
- Zero-knowledge, no-tracking file storage

### History Tracking
- Log all operations with timestamps
- Track uploaded files and their addresses
- Maintain comprehensive operation history
- Monitor network interactions

## Technical Details

The network employs:
- Multilayered encryption
- Self-encrypting data systems
- Zero-knowledge architecture
- Non-blockchain DLT technology
- Stigmergy-based consensus mechanism

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
- Pillow (PIL)
- Autonomi Network CLI tool installed

## Purpose

This GUI wrapper aims to make Autonomi Network's revolutionary technology accessible to everyone, supporting the vision of a decentralized internet owned by its users. It demonstrates how complex decentralized operations can be simplified for everyday use.
